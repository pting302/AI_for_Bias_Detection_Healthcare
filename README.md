Using Artificial Intelligence to expose bias in the Healthcare systems. 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Since the advent of hospital triaging and potentially even more prominently within the past few years of the Covid-19 pandemic, algorithmic bias has affected the way in which patients belonging to different demographic groups are prioritized in emergency room admissions, how medical supplies are pooled and concentrated, and more. Understanding the underlying causes of this phenomenon and exactly how this can favor some groups of people over others in the medical setting is crucial to creating an effective, fair, and beneficial method of triaging patients, especially in low resourced communities.
Previous studies such as that of Jacob M. Vigil, PhD et al., utilizing statistical techniques on collected pain intensity rating aspects, reveal that African Americans and Latinoamericans displayed a much higher degree of pain inflicted by their diseases than their white counterparts in the same level of prioritization in Emergency Room admittances. Given the health catastrophe over the course of the previous 3 years, our aim is to develop and utilize more advanced and thorough techniques within the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide an even clearer picture into the treatment and possible mistreatment of specific patient demographics in the hospital setting.
